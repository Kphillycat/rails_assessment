Rails Assesment

How does rails communicate with the database?  Please be thorough in discussing all the config files and pieces of rails necessary to communicate with the database.

- Rails communicates to the DB through an ORM like ActiveRecord. First steps is to setup your database in your config/database.yml file, which rails does by default setting up sqlite. You'll also need to create a migration in the db/migrate folder, then run in which would create the schema.rb file. The actual database is located in db/schema.rb. You have the option of leveraging the db/seeds.rb file to prepopulate your database with test data.

Describe the flow of a request from a users browser through the rails stack and back.
- The browser sends a request to the server, the server then matches that request route with the controller and action in the config/routes.rb file. The controller action then performs whatever logic is needed then the view page is rendered along with any preprocessing that needs to be done before being a pure html document. That HTML document is then sent back to the browser to be shown on the screen.

What are HTTP verbs?
- GET, PUT/PATCH, POST, DELETE

Why do we use migrations.
- Migrations are how we set up the database schema via the ORM. Migrations are basically the set of instructions to recreate that schema.
